  <h2 id="toc-introduction-jsconcurrency">The Problem: JavaScript Concurrency</h2>
  <p>There are a number of bottlenecks preventing interesting applications from being ported
  (say, from server-heavy implementations) to client-side JavaScript. Some of these include
  browser compatibility, static typing, accessibility, and performance. Fortunately, the latter
  is quickly becoming a thing of the past as browser vendors rapidly improve the speed of their JavaScript engines.</p>

  <p>One thing that's remained a hindrance for JavaScript is actually the language itself. JavaScript is
  a single-threaded environment, meaning multiple scripts cannot run at the same time. As an example, imagine
  a site that needs to handle UI events, query and process large amounts of API data,
  and manipulate the DOM. Pretty common, right? Unfortunately all of that can't be simultaneous
  due to limitations in browsers' JavaScript runtime. Script execution happens within a single thread.</p>

  <p>Developers mimic 'concurrency' by using techniques like
  <code>setTimeout()</code>, <code>setInterval()</code>, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, and event handlers.
  Yes, all of these features run asynchronously, but non-blocking doesn't necessarily mean concurrency.
  Asynchronous events are processed after the current executing script has yielded. The good news is
  that HTML5 gives us something better than these hacks!</p>

  <h2 id="toc-introduction-jsthreading">Introducing Web Workers: Bring Threading to JavaScript</h2>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">Web Workers</a> specification defines
  an API for spawning background scripts in your web application. Web Workers allow you to do things like
  fire up long-running scripts to handle computationally intensive tasks, but without blocking the UI or other
  scripts to handle user interactions. They're going to help put and end to that nasty 'unresponsive script' dialog
  that we've all come to love:</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/workers/unresponsive_script.gif" width="450" height="100" title="Unresponsive script dialog" alt="Unresponsive script dialog" />
  </div>

  <p>Workers utilize thread-like message passing to achieve parallelism. They're perfect for keeping your
  UI refresh, performant, and responsive for users.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-introduction-types">Types of Web Workers</h3>

  <p>It's worth noting that the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">specification</a> discusses
  two kinds of Web Workers, <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#dedicated-workers-and-the-worker-interface">Dedicated Workers</a>
  and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#sharedworker">Shared Workers</a>. This article will
  only cover dedicated workers and I'll refer to them as 'web workers' or 'workers' throughout.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

  <p>Web Workers run in an isolated thread. As a result, the code that they execute needs to be contained in a separate file.
  But before we do that, the first thing to do is create a new <code>Worker</code> object in your main page. The
  constructor takes the name of the worker script:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var worker = new Worker('task.js');
</pre>

  <p>If the specified file exists, the browser will spawn a new worker thread, which is downloaded asynchronously.
  The worker will not begin until the file has completely downloaded and executed. If the path to your worker returns an 404,
  the worker will fail silently.</p>

  <p>After creating the worker, start it by calling the <code>postMessage()</code> method:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
worker.postMessage(); // Start the worker.
</pre>

  <h3 id="toc-gettingstarted-workercomm">Communicating with a Worker via Message Passing</h3>

  <p>Communication between a work and its parent page is done using an event model and the <code>postMessage()</code>
  method. Depending on your browser/version, <code>postMessage()</code> can accept either a string or JSON object as its single argument.
  The latest versions of the modern browsers support passing a JSON object.</p>

  <p>Below is a example of using a string to pass 'Hello World' to a worker in doWork.js. The worker simply returns
  the message that is passed to it.</p>

  <p>Main script:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var worker = new Worker('doWork.js');

worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  console.log('Worker said: ', e.data);
}, false);

worker.postMessage('Hello World'); // Send data to our worker.
</pre>

  <p>doWork.js (the worker):</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
self.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  self.postMessage(e.data);
}, false);
</pre>

  <p>When <code>postMessage()</code> is called from the main page, our worker handles that message by
  defining an <code>onmessage</code> handler for the <code>message</code> event. The message payload (in this case 'Hello World')
  is accessible in <code>Event.data</code>. Although this particular example isn't very exciting, it demonstrates
  that <code>postMessage()</code> is also your means for passing data back to the main thread. Convenient!</p>

  <p>Messages passed between the main page and workers are copied, not shared. For example, in the next example
  the 'msg' property of the JSON message is accessible in both locations. It appears that the object is
  being passed directly to the worker even though it's running in a separate, dedicated space. In actuality, what is happening
  is that the object is being serialized as it's handed to the worker, and subsequently, de-serialized on the other end. The page and
  worker do not share the same instance, so the end result is that a duplicate is created on each pass. Most browsers implement this feature by automatically JSON encoding/decoding the value on either end.</p>

  <p>The following is a more complex example that passes messages using JSON objects.</p>

  <p>Main script:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;button onclick="sayHI()"&gt;Say HI&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onclick="unknownCmd()"&gt;Send unknown command&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onclick="stop()"&gt;Stop worker&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;output id="result"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function sayHI() {
    worker.postMessage({'cmd': 'start', 'msg': 'Hi'});
  }

  function stop() {
    // Calling worker.terminate() from this script would also stop the worker.
    worker.postMessage({'cmd': 'stop', 'msg': 'Bye'});
  }

  function unknownCmd() {
    worker.postMessage({'cmd': 'foobard', 'msg': '???'});
  }

  var worker = new Worker('doWork2.js');

  worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    document.getElementById('result').textContent = e.data;
  }, false);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

  <p>doWork2.js:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
self.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  var data = e.data;
  switch (data.cmd) {
    case 'start':
      self.postMessage('WORKER STARTED: ' + data.msg);
      break;
    case 'stop':
      self.postMessage('WORKER STOPPED: ' + data.msg + '. (buttons will no longer work)');
      self.close(); // Terminates the worker.
      break;
    default:
      self.postMessage('Unknown command: ' + data.msg);
  };
}, false);
</pre>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: There are two ways to stop a worker: by calling <code>worker.terminate()</code> from the main page
  or by calling <code>self.close()</code> inside of the worker itself.</p>

  <p><strong>Example</strong>: Run this worker!</p>
  <div class="example">
    <button onclick="sayHI()">Say HI</button>
    <button onclick="unknownCmd()">Send unknown command</button>
    <button onclick="stop()">Stop worker</button>
    <output id="result"></output>
  </div>

  <h2 id="toc-enviornment">The Worker Environment</h2>

  <h3 id="toc-enviornment-scope">Worker Scope</h3>

  <p>In the context of a worker, both <code>self</code> and <code>this</code> reference the global scope
  for the worker. Thus, the previous example could also be written as:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  var data = e.data;
  switch (data.cmd) {
    case 'start':
      postMessage('WORKER STARTED: ' + data.msg);
      break;
    case 'stop':
  ...
}, false);
</pre>

  <p>Alternatively, you could set the <code>onmessage</code> event handler directly
  (though <code>addEventListener</code> is always encouraged by JavaScript ninjas).</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
onmessage = function(e) {
  var data = e.data;
  ...
};
</pre>

  <h3 id="toc-enviornment-features">Features Available to Workers</h3>

  <p>Due to their multi-threaded behavior, web workers only has access to a subset of JavaScript's features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>navigator</code> object</li>
    <li>The <code>location</code> object (read-only)</li>
    <li><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></li>
    <li><code>setTimeout()/clearTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()/clearInterval()</code></li>
    <li>The <a href="/tutorials/appcache/beginner/">Application Cache</a></li>
    <li>Importing external scripts using the <code>importScripts()</code> method</li>
    <li><a href="#toc-enviornment-subworkers">Spawning other web workers</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Workers do NOT have access to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The DOM (it's not thread-safe)</li>
    <li>The <code>window</code> object</li>
    <li>The <code>document</code> object</li>
    <li>The <code>parent</code> object</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="toc-enviornment-loadingscripts">Loading External Scripts</h3>

  <p>You can load external script files or libraries into a worker with the <code>importScripts()</code> function. The method
  takes zero or more strings representing the filenames for the resources to import.</p>

  <p>This example loads <code>script1.js</code> and <code>script2.js</code> into the worker:</p>

  <p>worker.js:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
importScripts('script1.js');
importScripts('script2.js');
</pre>

  <p>Which can also be written as a single import statement:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
importScripts('script1.js', 'script2.js');
</pre>

  <h3 id="toc-enviornment-subworkers">Subworkers</h3>

  <p>Workers have the ability to spawn child workers. This is great for further breaking up large
  tasks at runtime. However, subworkers come with a few caveats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Subworkers must be hosted within the same origin as the parent page. </li>
    <li>URIs within subworkers are resolved relative to their parent worker's location (as opposed to the main page).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep in mind most browsers spawn separate processes for each worker. Before you go spawning a worker
  farm, be cautious about hogging too many of the user's system resources. One reason for this is that messages
  passed between main pages and workers are copied, not shared. See <a href="#toc-gettingstarted-workercomm">Communicating with a Worker via Message Passing</a>.</p>

  <p>For an sample of how to spawn a subworker, see <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/#delegation">the example</a>
  in the specification.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-errors">Handling Errors</h2>

  <p>As with any JavaScript logic, you'll want to handle any errors that are thrown in your web workers.
  If an error occurs while a worker is executing, the an <code>ErrorEvent</code> is fired. The interface contains three useful properties for figuring out what went wrong: <code>filename</code> - the name of the worker script
  that caused the error, <code>lineno</code> - the line number where the error occurred, and <code>message</code> - a meaningful
  description of the error. Here is an example of setting up an <code>onerror</code> event handler to print the properties of the error:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;output id="error" style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
&lt;output id="result"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  function onError(e) {
    document.getElementById('error').textContent = [
      'ERROR: Line ', e.lineno, ' in ', e.filename, ': ', e.message].join('');
  }

  function onMsg(e) {
    document.getElementById('result').textContent = e.data;
  }

  var worker = new Worker('workerWithError.js');
  worker.addEventListener('message', onMsg, false);
  worker.addEventListener('error', onError, false);
  worker.postMessage(); // Start worker without a message.
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

  <p><strong>Example</strong>: workerWithError.js tries to perform 1/x, where x is undefined.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <button onclick="startErrorWorker()">Run it</button>
    <output id="error" style="color:red;"></output>
    <output id="result2"></output>
  </div>

  <p>workerWithError.js:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
self.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  postMessage(1/x); // Intentional error.
};
</pre>

  <h2 id="toc-security">A Word on Security</h2>

  <h3 id="toc-security-local">Restrictions with Local Access</h3>

  <p>Due to Google Chrome's security restrictions, workers will not run locally (e.g. from <code>file://</code>) in the latest
  versions of the browser. Instead, they fail silently!  To run your app from the <code>file://</code> scheme, run Chrome with the
  <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> flag set.
  <strong>NOTE</strong>: It is not recommended to run your primary browser with this flag set. It should only be used for testing purposes
  and not regular browsing.</p>

  <p>Other browsers do not impose the same restriction.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-security-origin">Same Origin Considerations</h3>

  <p>Worker scripts must be external files with the same scheme as their calling page. Thus,
  you cannot load a script from a <code>data:</code> URL or <code>javascript:</code> URL, and an <code>https:</code>
  page cannot start worker scripts that begin with <code>http:</code> URLs.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-usecases">Use Cases</h2>

  <p>So what kind app would utilize web workers? Unfortunately, web workers are still relatively new and
  the majority of samples/tutorials out there involve computing prime numbers. Although that isn't very interesting,
  it's useful for understanding the concepts of web workers. Here are a few more ideas to get your brain churning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefetching and/or caching data for later use</li>
    <li>Code syntax highlighting or other real-time text formatting</li>
    <li>Spell checker</li>
    <li>Analyzing video or audio data</li>
    <li>Background I/O or polling of webservices</li>
    <li>Processing large arrays or humungous JSON responses</li>
    <li>Image filtering in &lt;canvas&gt;</li>
    <li>Updaing many rows of a local web database</li>
  </ul>
