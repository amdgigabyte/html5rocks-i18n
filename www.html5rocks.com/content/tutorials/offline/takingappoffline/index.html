  <h2 id="toc-intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    There are two main components to Offline support in HTML.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Application Cache, used for caching application files such as
       html, images, javascript and css;</li>
    <li>and Databases used for data access and key based lookups such as 
      localStorage and sessionStorage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This sample demonstrates how to take your applications offline using the 
    Applications cache, by extending the Database functionality in the
    <a href="/tutorials/webdatabase/todo/">to-do list manager</a> tutorial.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TODO list manager already demonstrates the use of client-side databases,
    so combining this with the Application Cache and using all the same 
    Javascript and HTML so it will give you a really clear indication
    of how simple it can be to take your applications offline.
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-step0">What is the Application Cache</h2>
  <p>
    The Application Cache (or App Cache for short) is designed to let you 
    declaratively specify your web application's required resources in a 
    manifest file. The resources listed in the manifest will be proactively 
    downloaded and stored by the browser.
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-step1">Step 1. Creating a basic manifest</h2>
  <p>Because we already have an application on the web, it is a simple 
    process to add offline support.  The first that we need to do is to 
    create our manifest file.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">CACHE MANIFEST
# Revision: 1
index.html
script.js
base.css</pre>
  <p>
    As you can see it is pretty simple. The manifest file contains a simple
    list of the three files that we will be using and a comment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The browser will re-download all the files in the manifest
    if it detects a single change in the manifest file.  Therefore, if you
    are deploying software and making changes, you can use this simple comment
    to ensure that all your users download the latest application.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="toc-step2">Step 2. Attaching the manifest</h2>
  <p>
    For the browser to be able find the manifest file, we need to reference it
    from the root html element.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;html manifest="cache.manifest"&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    The presence of this attribute will invoke the browser to download the 
    manifest file and start the process of acquiring the resources needed to 
    ensure your application is available in offline mode.
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-step3">Step 3. Pulling the plug (Testing)</h2>
  If you have correctly listed all the application files, then your application
  will be available offline.  
  <p>
  For an example see our sample application: 
  <a href="/tutorials/offline/todo/">Offline To-do list</a>. In this application,
  we are using all the same code as our previous To-do sample,
   but now it is available offline.
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-further">Taking it further</h2>
  <p>This is a pretty simple example, in reality applications are a
    little more in-depth.  So now is a good time to cover some more features
    of the App Cache.</p>
    
  <h3 id="toc-mixin">Mixing Offline and Online</h3>
  <p>
    Quite often you will not want to package all your files inside one offline
    manifest, for instance, you might have an online help system that your users
    will reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure that your users don't get a "404 Page Not Found" error when
    visiting your help pages, you can specify a "FALLBACK" page in your manifest.
    This page will be presented to your users in place of the browser default 
    404 page. 
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">CACHE MANIFEST
# A list of the files that are need for this application
# Rev 25
index.html  
script.js 
base.css

FALLBACK:
/ offline.html</pre>
  <p>
    To see this in action use our sample <a href="/tutorials/offline/todo/">Offline 
    To-do list</a> application, disconnect from the Internet and click on 
    <a href="/tutorials/offline/todo/help.html">Online help</a>. HINT: You 
    should see a Whoopsie page.
  </p>
  <h3 id="toc-dynamic">Accessing dynamic content</h3>
  <p>
    By default the application cache will not allow users to access resources
    that have not been defined in the manifest.  This means that access to 
    dynamic data, such as a backend DB or a remote web API such as Twitter will
    fail.
  </p>
  <p>
    The designers of the spec anticipated this scenario and created a "NETWORK"
    section in the manifest definition that allows you to specify a whitelist
    of addresses that will always be allowed through the cache.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">CACHE MANIFEST
# A list of the files that are need for this application
# Rev 26
index.html  
script.js 
base.css

NETWORK:
/getweather</pre>
  <p>
    In this example, any requests to our "/getweather" API will be allowed 
    through.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we had another API called "/getstocks", but it wasn't defined in the 
    "NETWORK" section, all requests to that API would fail.
  </p>
  <p>
    But lets say you have lots of API's or remote resources that are too 
    numerous to enumerate in the manifest file, what can you do?  The designers
    thought of this too and allow you to white list resources.
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">CACHE MANIFEST
# A list of the files that are need for this application
# Rev 26
index.html  
script.js 
base.css

NETWORK:
bin/*</pre>
  <p>
    You can now call any resource in the bin directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    When your application goes offline, requests to anything in the 
    "NETWORK" section will fail and will need to be handled by your code.  
    The FALLBACK mechanism will not kick in.
  </p>
  <h3 id="toc-updates">Detecting Updates</h3>
  <p>There is a very strong chance that you will need to update your application,
    be it bug fixes or great new functionality. Once an application is offline
    it remains so until a user clears their browse cache or you programatically
    update their version of the code.</p>
  <p>
    The good thing is, the browser can handle all of this. Earlier we talked 
    about the browser detecting updates to the manifest, when this occurs the 
    browser will download all the latest resources and send an event to your 
    JavaScript indicating that an update is available.  You can present your
    users with a notification to inform them that they can update the application
    to a latest version.
  </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">// Called onload of the body element
init = function() {
  var status = document.getElementById("#status");
  var updateButton = document.getElementById("#update");
  updateButton.addEventListener("click", updateApplication);
  
  window.applicationCache.addEventListener('updateready', function() { 
    status.innerText = "There is an update ready";
    }, false);
};

updateApplication = function(){
  // Ensure the browser uses the latest version of the code
  window.applicationCache.swapCache();
  // Reload the application
  window.location.reload();
};</pre>
  <p>
    It must be noted, some browsers will load the new application the next time
    your user uses your application.  Some browsers will require you to perform
    a swapCache(), therefore it makes sense to programatically update the user
    to the new version.
  </p>
  <h3 id="toc-access">Accessing Web API's</h3>
  <p>
    Lets say you are building a Google Buzz client, you have made it 
    offline enabled and you want to use JSONP to access Buzz directly.  You will
    quickly find that it won't work. App Cache doesn't let you white-list
    requests to cross domain resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what can you do? You will need to build a simple proxy on your domain 
    that you can use to white-list requests to external resources
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-wrap">Wrapping it up</h2>
  <p>
    We have seen that it is pretty simple to take your existing applications
    offline.  At the simplest level it is just a process of defining a 
    basic manifest file and attaching it to your root html element.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have also seen the extra things that you can do to drastically improve
    the user experience of your applications with enhancements such as 
    NETWORK whitelisting, FALLBACK support and capturing events.
  </p>
  <p>But the best thing of all is, your application will still work online with
    browsers that don't support App Cache.</p>
